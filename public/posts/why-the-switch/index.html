        <h1 id="what-happened">What Happened?</h1>
<p>If this isn&rsquo;t your first time on my website, you might notice that not only is the domain different, there is also a drastic change of style. That is because I have switched over from Wordpress.</p>
<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr I am too lazy to migrate the old one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Assuming you know a slight bit about website building (if you don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t mind the rest because it will only get more and more technical as we discuss), you must know Wordpress. It&rsquo;s the most widely used website CMS (content management system) around the world. In fact, more than half of the websites in the world are built using Wordpress. The no-code, user-friendly interface and logic makes it easy for beginners. That&rsquo;s why most of my previous websites are Wordpress-based, including my original blog.</p>
<p>Not wanting to pay for hosting, I figured out that GitHub Pages is my best option since traffic won&rsquo;t be high and Git makes it easier to keep track of edits. But the biggest setback of using GitHub Pages is that it can only host static websites. The definition of a static website is that it&rsquo;s built purely with HTML and CSS (sometimes including JS), but to be descriptive, it indicates that the website doesn&rsquo;t have any interactive functions and is stationary. Because the backend of Wordpress is not static, it needs to be converted to static with another program, and that&rsquo;s what I did for my last blog.</p>
<p>Even though the editing was flawless and the only additional step is to convert it to static, another issue occurred when I switched to a new PC: simply cloning or pulling from Git is not enough, and re-installing Wordpress and all the plugins I was using is a big hassle.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I finally decided to continue blogging. But this time, I have decided to start over and switch to Hugo. Not only is it faster in rendering, I can also use the CMS remotely on a browser without using Git. All I have to do is do a one-time OAuth app setup, and I can access the admin panel anywhere with my GitHub account.</p>
<p>Another reason not to use Wordpress is that Hugo renders based on markdown files. My daily noting driver is Joplin, and it also uses markdown. This means I can blog whenever I want, even on a plane, and upload it directly once I have internet access.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s all my main reasons for switching, excluding a few minor ones, like customization, that I didn&rsquo;t mention. But that&rsquo;s all for today, and I&rsquo;ll slowly be migrating some of the posts on the previous website to this one. See y&rsquo;all next time!</p>
